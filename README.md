- 👋 Hi, I’m Soumyadip 
- 👀 I’m interested in Non-linear dynamics, Systems Biology, Machine learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI). Have experience in building and analysis of mathematical models (both deterministic and stochastic) of complex systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML and AI using python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project that involves ML and AI tools to solve a problem. The problem doesnot necessarily have to be in the bio domain. I open to work in other fields.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop a mail at banerjeesoumyadip17@gmail.com
